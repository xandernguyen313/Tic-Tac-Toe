- As a user, I should be able to select where to place my Xs or Os
- As a user, I should know whether I have lost or won or tie
- As a user, I should be able to see how many times I have lost and won
- As a user, I should not be able to play the same position twice
- As a user, I should not be able to play when it is not my turn
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing my page
